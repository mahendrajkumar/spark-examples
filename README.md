spark-examples using Java-8 lambda expressions :
================================================

Lambda expression is one of the new features introduced in Java8. Java is a strongly typed object oriented language. Functions were never first class citizens of Java language. The introduction of lambda expressions in Java8 enables treating functionality as method argument.  Lambdas do not actually allow functions to be passed around, but, they provide short cut to creating anonymous inner class containing a single method.  So, lambda expression is about writing concise and clear code. It also encourages functional style thinking.
